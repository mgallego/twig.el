The instalation of twig.el is very simple.

1. Make sure twig.el is in your load-path (stick it in .emacs.d or whatnot)

2. (require 'twig) in your .emacs

3. Asociate the twig files with the minor mode

(setq auto-mode-alist
      (append '(("\\.twig?$" . twig-minor-mode)) auto-mode-alist))
(add-to-list 'auto-mode-alist '("\\.twig$" . twig-minor-mode))

Thats is all

You can view the atual functions of the library in HOWTO doc in the repository.
